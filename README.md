# LEAF_DISEASE_DETECTION_USING_MACHINE_LEARNING
This project aims to develop a system for the automated detection of plant diseases from images of leaves and providing suitable solutions to mitigate them. Leveraging image processing techniques, the system analyzes input leaf images, identifies diseases present, and offers recommendations for treatment or prevention.
